# The Gamification of Fitbit
## How an API Provided the Next Level of tRaining

I wanted to try out a bunch of cool new things in R like making a personal website using blogdown, using gganimate with Rokemon, accessing the fitbit API with httr and adding a background image with some custom CSS/HTML. Is there possibly a better way to possibly gamify my leaRning curve - I think not.
